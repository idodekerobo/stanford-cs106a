# stanford-cs106a
My work as I go through the Stanford CS106A - Programming Methodology course.

Course Links:

Stanford Engineering Everywhere (SEE) Course: https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS106A/171
Current Course: http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106a/

Stanford's SEE courses are offered for free with videos, handouts, assignments, and exams to anyone. The SEE version of this course is from 2008. It comes with about ~30 50min-long lectures.

Thte Current Version of this course is from Winter 2019. 

Much of the content is the same, but usually I've used the SEE course videos, the current course homework/assignments (and in some cases combined the homework of both new and old), and the current course's supplementary material.
